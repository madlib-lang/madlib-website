Madlib attempts to build atop a few instances of prior art. It is designed to feel a bit like [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and a bit like [JavaScript in a functional paradigm](https://ramdajs.com). Because it is designed with JavaScript in mind, there are low-level escape hatches (see [The Fence](/docs/the-fence) for one such affordance) so that it is easy to built within the existing JavaScript ecosystem, while adding the confidence and assurances that a statically compiled well-typed language affords.
